Pradeep: Initial release - Tested:
I have written a small algorithm to fetch the acceleration data from the mobile application "phyphox". 

Shaker: Release 2 - Tested:
A gesture recording algorithm has been developed by @smarteye4g. 
The algorithm records data on the go. The data is collected through an android app - PhonePi.
The starting and the ending of the gestures are identified by a specific position for a specific amount of time.
There is a sound produced to indicate the start and end of a gesture to the user.
